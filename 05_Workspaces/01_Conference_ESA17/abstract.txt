The work presents the intelligent platform that was developed for visualising, analysing and comparing global land coverage in Europe. The global data available in the webGIS are: GLC-2000 (2000), CORINE (1990, 2000, 2006 and 2016), GlobCover (2004-2006 and 2009), MODIS (2001-2012), CCI project (2000, 2005 and 2010), GlobeLand30 (2000 and 2010), Urban Atlas (2006 and 2012), HSL (XXXXX) and Global Urban Footprint (2016).  The data storage consists in two major elements: the raster data storage, i.e. a collection of pre-processed GeoTIFF files optimized to increase the web map server performance; and the vector data storage, which is built on the PostgreSQL DBMS with PostGIS spatial extension. 
The client, built upon the Bootstrap framework and Font Awesome icons is designed to have a similar navigability of a desktop GIS, where users can activate, order (e.g. drag and drop operation) and modify some of the layers’ properties (e.g. opacity). In addition, it is possible to upload external land coverage/land use maps or any other geospatial data via Web Map Services (WMS) provided that the user enters a valid GetCapabilities URL address. The results are parsed via a JavaScript function and rendered by Leaflet. Besides those functionalities, the platform provides the possibilities of processing on-the-fly selected data (in a rectangular area) in terms of change detection analysis and computation of the confusion matrix and related indexes (overall accuracy, Monia please add…). Finally, geotagged photos from some popular photo sharing services (Flickr, Panoramio and Geograph) that provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for extracting their data can be added to the maps.
